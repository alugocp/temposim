# TempoSim
This is my project for the **ImmersiveAtoms x Tempo** art show at **NextNOW Fest 2019**.
 I made a visualization to go along with a live performance of newly-composed music.

 ## Build
 Run `make` to build and `make run` to run. The Makefile uses `javac` to compile the code and `java` to run it, nothing fancy.
